To-do list for the Python to Debian converter
=============================================

- Automated tests!
- Decide whether to abandon custom+virtual prefixes; do it.
- Try to get rid of the Debian version suffix in dependencies?!

Ideas
-----
- Custom Exception?
- Support "extra" requirements (optional dependencies, like suggests/enhances)?
- Command-line option: Create config template in current directory?
